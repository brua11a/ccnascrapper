What defines a host route on a Cisco router?
The link-local address is added automatically to the routing table as an IPv6 host route.
An IPv4 static host route configuration uses a destination IP address of a specific device and a /32 subnet mask.
A host route is designated with a C in the routing table.
A static IPv6 host route must include the interface type and the interface number of the next hop router.
