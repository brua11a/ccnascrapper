A small publishing company has a network design such that when a broadcast is sent on the LAN, 200 devices receive the transmitted broadcast. How can the network administrator reduce the number of devices that receive broadcast traffic?
Add more switches so that fewer devices are on a particular switch.
Replace the switches with switches that have more ports per switch. This will allow more devices on a particular switch.
Segment the LAN into smaller LANs and route between them.*
Replace at least half of the switches with hubs to reduce the size of the broadcast domain.
