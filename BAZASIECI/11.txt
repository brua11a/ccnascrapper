Which statement is correct about how a Layer 2 switch determines how to forward frames?
Frame forwarding decisions are based on MAC address and port mappings in the CAM table.
Only frames with a broadcast destination address are forwarded out all active switch ports.
Unicast frames are always forwarded regardless of the destination MAC address.
Cut-through frame forwarding ensures that invalid frames are always dropped.
