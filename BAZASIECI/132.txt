A new switch is to be added to an existing network in a remote office. The network administrator does not want the technicians in the remote office to be able to add new VLANs to the switch, but the switch should receive VLAN updates from the VTP domain. Which two steps must be performed to configure VTP on the new switch to meet these conditions? (Choose two.)
Configure the new switch as a VTP client.
Configure the existing VTP domain name on the new switch.
Configure an IP address on the new switch.
Configure all ports of both switches to access mode.
Enable VTP pruning.
