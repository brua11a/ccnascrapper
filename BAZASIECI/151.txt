A junior technician was adding a route to a LAN router. A traceroute to a device on the new network revealed a wrong path and unreachable status. What should be done or checked?
Create a floating static route to that network.
Check the configuration on the floating static route and adjust the AD.
Check the configuration of the exit interface on the new static route.
Verify that the static route to the server is present in the routing table.
