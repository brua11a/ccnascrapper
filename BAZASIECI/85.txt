A network engineer is troubleshooting a newly deployed wireless network that is using the latest 802.11 standards. When users access high bandwidth services such as streaming video, the wireless network performance is poor. To improve performance the network engineer decides to configure a 5 Ghz frequency band SSID and train users to use that SSID for streaming media services. Why might this solution improve the wireless network performance for that type of service?
Requiring the users to switch to the 5 GHz band for streaming media is inconvenient and will result in fewer users accessing these services.
The 5 GHz band has more channels and is less crowded than the 2.4 GHz band, which makes it more suited to streaming multimedia.
The 5 GHz band has a greater range and is therefore likely to be interference-free.
The only users that can switch to the 5 GHz band will be those with the latest wireless NICs, which will reduce usage.
