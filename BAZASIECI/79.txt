A technician is configuring a router for a small company with multiple WLANs and doesnâ€™t need the complexity of a dynamic routing protocol. What should be done or checked?
Verify that there is not a default route in any of the edge router routing tables.
Create static routes to all internal networks and a default route to the internet.
Create extra static routes to the same location with an AD of 1.
Check the statistics on the default route for oversaturation.
