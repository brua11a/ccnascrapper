Users are complaining of sporadic access to the internet every afternoon. What should be done or checked?
Create static routes to all internal networks and a default route to the internet.
Verify that there is not a default route in any of the edge router routing tables.
Create a floating static route to that network.
Check the statistics on the default route for oversaturation.
