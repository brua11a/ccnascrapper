Successful inter-VLAN routing has been operating on a network with multiple VLANs across multiple switches for some time. When an inter-switch trunk link fails and Spanning Tree Protocol brings up a backup trunk link, it is reported that hosts on two VLANs can access some, but not all the network resources that could be accessed previously. Hosts on all other VLANS do not have this problem. What is the most likely cause of this problem?
The protected edge port function on the backup trunk interfaces has been disabled.
The allowed VLANs on the backup link were not configured correctly.
Dynamic Trunking Protocol on the link has failed.
Inter-VLAN routing also failed when the trunk link failed.
