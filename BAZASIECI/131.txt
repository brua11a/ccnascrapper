A WLAN engineer deploys a WLC and five wireless APs using the CAPWAP protocol with the DTLS feature to secure the control plane of the network devices. While testing the wireless network, the WLAN engineer notices that data traffic is being exchanged between the WLC and the APs in plain-text and is not being encrypted. What is the most likely reason for this?
DTLS only provides data security through authentication and does not provide encryption for data moving between a wireless LAN controller (WLC) and an access point (AP).
Although DTLS is enabled by default to secure the CAPWAP control channel, it is disabled by default for the data channel.
DTLS is a protocol that only provides security between the access point (AP) and the wireless client.
Data encryption requires a DTLS license to be installed on each access point (AP) prior to being enabled on the wireless LAN controller (WLC).
