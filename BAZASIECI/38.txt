A junior technician was adding a route to a LAN router. A traceroute to a device on the new network revealed a wrong path and unreachable status. What should be done or checked?
Verify that there is not a default route in any of the edge router routing tables.
Check the configuration on the floating static route and adjust the AD.
Create a floating static route to that network.
Check the configuration of the exit interface on the new static route.
