What are two characteristics of Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)? (Choose two.)
When a packet arrives on a router interface, it is forwarded to the control plane where the CPU matches the destination address with a matching routing table entry.
This is the fastest forwarding mechanism on Cisco routers and multilayer switches.
With this switching method, flow information for a packet is stored in the fast-switching cache to forward future packets to the same destination without CPU intervention.
Packets are forwarded based on information in the FIB and an adjacency table.
When a packet arrives on a router interface, it is forwarded to the control plane where the CPU searches for a match in the fast-switching cache.
