X1000
An administrator is trying to remove configurations from a switch. After using the command erase startup-config and reloading the switch, the administrator finds that VLANs 10 and 100 still exist on the switch. Why were these VLANs not removed?
Because these VLANs are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory, this file must be manually deleted.
These VLANs cannot be deleted unless the switch is in VTP client mode.
These VLANs are default VLANs that cannot be removed.
These VLANs can only be removed from the switch by using the no vlan 10 and no vlan 100 commands.
